//These are client-side files that should all end in "s".  We are in the middle of a significant transition, so there will be a number of files in here that do not follow the rules.  These files are not supposed to contain any queries, but must depend on the business layer instead.  There actually might not be very many files in here by the time we are done.  We are moving all of these files into the business layer and ending them with D for data, instead of s.
