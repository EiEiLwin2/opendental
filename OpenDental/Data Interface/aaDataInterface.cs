//We are in the middle of a significant transition, and most of these files need to be moved to the business layer.  There, they will retain their "s" ending.  Any client-side files that need to remain here can be named with a "(s)_client" ending.  Any files that remain here will not contain any queries, but must depend on the business layer instead.  Once the transition is complete, this folder will be renamed.
